# LootLocker-Godot-SDK

## Disclaimer
This was just the beginning of an SDK for Godot. The LootLocker Team said that it has plans for an official Godot SDK, but as for now, this is what I came up with.
It also by far does not cover all the LootLocker features as Ares2 have just added the most important features that I needed. Those include
- User authentication (guest login, white label login, Steam & Google will come later first)
- Leaderboards (almost all features)
- some misc features (ping)

This is a work in progress, it is barely usable for now, so DO NOT report issue as there are plenty, known or not yet known. You still can submit PR for features, bug fix or other things.
Stay tuned.

### SDK init

This sample shows how to initialize the SDK in order to use it with your game.

### ping test

Just a little sample of _ping_ call.

### guest login demo

As the title suggest, this is the basic authentication to LootLocker backend. It is used to hide auth mechanism from players who just want to play your game without having to create first another account somewhere and give away tons of private informations :).

### white label demo

As opposite to the previous auth method, this one use email/password combination and account creation, with eail verification step. It is used to deal with various features like plyers's inventory, progression, mission, and many more, where a dedicated account is more than needed and worth the time spent.

### generate data

A little program to create many random players at once and submit random score to a given leaderboard.Mostly for testing purpose.

### fake game demo

This is what a game could be regarding player auth & leaderboard interactions.

## Sample game provided

### Dodge the creeps official tutorial game

TODO (add guest login + leaderboard, then maybe a WL version of auth)
