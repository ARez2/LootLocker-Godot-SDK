# Setup the LootLocker SDK
## setup your own LockLocker account

In order to fully benefit from this SDK, you've to create a **_LootLocker_ account** first, it's free, easy and pretty quick.

Go to [LootLocker website](https://lootlocker.com/) and click on the big button on the top right corner
![LL-create-account](https://github.com/ARez2/LootLocker-Godot-SDK/assets/136735040/6a4d9744-c93f-4e73-a614-ee4c4ed56308)

Enter you email address and a password, then follow the account creation process.
Then, a good place to start is the [documentation](https://docs.lootlocker.com/the-basics/readme), it's worth reading it to understand the basics and be able to build on strong foundations.

## Create a game

Create a game, give it the name you want, "_SDK-test_" could be a good one for our purpose here.

## Get keys

The **keys** will be use to be able to interact with _LootLocker_ system using the SDK.
Click on settings icon, then keys as displayed on the picture below

(note these keys are **mine**, and I don't mind these as this is just a dummy game created for the purpose of this documentation, you'll see different values for you own keys to use later)

I willingly don't go deep into the details as the official documentation cover already everything so, again, use it.

For now, only the API key is use by the SDK. So we're ready to dive into the matter and actually setup the SDK, let'go !
